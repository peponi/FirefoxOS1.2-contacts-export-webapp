## CouchDB setup (if you want to sync your data to your [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org))

you need to enable [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)

[github.com/pouchdb/add-cors-to-couchdb](https://github.com/pouchdb/add-cors-to-couchdb#what-it-does)

*CouchDB doesn't come with CORS enabled by default. This is a problem for libraries like PouchDB, which depend on being able to access CouchDB ...*
